        <center><h1>Fun Facts about the International Space Station</h1></center>
        <div class = "box">The space station has been home to astronauts for a really long time - since 2000! Can you imagine living in space for that long?</div>
        <div id="box2" class = "box">There are usually seven astronauts living and working on the space station. They fly around the Earth really fast - five miles per second. That's like racing around the Earth 16 times in one day. Because of this, the space station sees 16 sunrises and sunsets in a day!</div>
        <div class = "box">Peggy Whitson is a superhero astronaut! She spent 665 days living and working in space.</div>
        <div class = "box">Astronauts and cosmonauts (that's what we call astronauts from Russia) do cool spacewalks to fix things on the space station. It's like doing a really cool, really hard puzzle in space!</div>
        <div class = "box">The space station has really big solar panels that help it fly. They're even bigger than a really big airplane! Can you imagine having solar panels that big in your backyard?</div>
        <div class = "box">The international space station can connect to eight spaceships at the same time! That's like having a really big parking lot in space!</div>
        <div class = "box">Astronauts can get to the space station really quickly - in just four hours! </div>
        <div id="box2" class = "box">There are millions and millions of lines of special code that help the space station work properly. It's like a really cool, really hard computer game that astronauts play to keep the space station flying.</div>
